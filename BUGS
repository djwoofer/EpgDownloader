1. Application crashes if one of plugins was deleted.
Solution: Clear the plugins path file paths.pm, by putting there "1;"

2. WP plugin ommits the following day when running after midnight.

3. Parsing EuroTV website not always ends with successs (because of UTF-8 encoding).

4. UTF-8 is not yet supported. Iconv can be used as temporary solution:
iconv --from iso-8859-2 --to utf-8 xmltv.xml > xmltv.utf.xml
