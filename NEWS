- WP plugin is now able to import full episode's description. 
  To use it set FULL_DESCRIPTION option to '1'. 
  Notice that script must send individual request for every episode 
  to get its description. That's why it's VERY slow.

- New Interia plugin allows to import tv-schedule from tv.interia website.
  It has similar capabilitis to WP plugin but additionally it sets episode's 
  category (which could be usefull with xmltv export).

- New MiGuiaTV plugin allows to import tv-schedule from www.miguiatv.com website.

- New EuroTV plugin allows to import tv-schedule from www.eurotv.com website. It isn't stable!
